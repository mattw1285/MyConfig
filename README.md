# MyConfig

`MyConfig` is a centralised repo for my personal config files and env setup.
The goal is to minimise repetitive manual steps, automate common tasks and maintain a reproducible baseline.

This repo doubles as:
- A Safety Net
- Living Record Of Env
- Baseline Setup

This repo is intentionally opinionated and personal.
It’s not meant to be universal, but rather my evolving toolkit for personal projects.
