# MyConfig

The `MyConfig` repo is a centralised repo for my personal config files and env 
setup. The goal is to minimise repetitive manual steps, automate common tasks 
and maintain a reproducible baseline.

This repo doubles as:
- A Safety Net
- Living Record Of Env
- Baseline Setup

This repo is intentionally opinionated and personal. It’s not meant to be 
universal, but rather my evolving toolkit for personal projects.

Despite being somwhat overkill, _**I**nfrastructure **A**s **C**ode_ is where 
this is going... or at least my terrible version of. I don't quite have the 
need or hardware for terraform, so reflashing os drives it is!

## Goals:

- **Reproducibility** – quick and consistent env spin up
- **Incremental Improvement** – standardise setup while allowing refinement
- **Automation:** – reduce manual steps
- **Learning** - infra tasks and bash practice

---

```
"Your infrastructure should be a graveyard... Just like your list of nearly 
complete project" 
```

---

## How Two:

run `cd .../MyConfig/btw_i_use_vim && source setup.sh`...

Then maybe pray to the gods that I've looked at this recently, stopped 
procrastinating and learnt how to do it. But `setup.sh` should work fine.

I'll tell you about the os setup when i finish it lol! :D
